Problem Description:

When a web application is updated, even small changes can unintentionally break existing functionality. 
Regression testing is meant to catch these issues, but running all test cases every time is time-consuming, repetitive, and resource-intensive. 
As applications grow, the challenge lies in ensuring reliability and speed while avoiding wasted effort on redundant tests. 
There is a need for a smarter, automated process that reduces manual overhead, prioritizes critical functionality, and provides fast feedback during frequent release cycles.

 

Challenge:

In the traditional regression testing approach, testers often need to re-run the entire test suite after each application update, even if most functionalities remain unchanged. 
This results in significant time inefficiency, as executing large test suites delays release cycles. 
Maintaining and updating test cases also becomes a heavy burden, especially when the application evolves frequently. 
Since all tests are treated equally, there is no prioritization of critical areas, which can lead to wasted effort on low-impact scenarios while high-risk areas
may still be overlooked. The heavy reliance on manual intervention further increases the chances of human error and inconsistent execution. 
As applications grow larger, this approach becomes difficult to scale, making it a major blocker for fast, reliable, and continuous delivery.


Project Name: Software Functional Regression Testing using AI

Theme Name: AI-Powered Quality Shield

Who Can Work: Owner Only

Solution Approach:

The solution is to adopt an AI-driven regression testing process where intelligent automation handles both the execution and optimization of test cases. 
Instead of relying on manual coding, test scripts are connected to an AI assistant, 
which analyzes changes, selects the most relevant test cases, and triggers them through an automation layer. 
This ensures that only the most impactful scenarios are executed, reducing unnecessary test runs while maintaining coverage of critical features. 
The process runs in the background with minimal setup, automatically executing tests after each update, capturing results, and providing clear feedback on risks. 
This approach significantly speeds up testing cycles, reduces human error, and ensures that application functionality is validated effectively after every change.
